These are examples in the C language.

Also examples in the JavaScript language for:
 * TDD / ATDD / BDD.
 * UI Testing / Protractor
 * Unit Testing

 But we'd like to use TypeScript as well.

If possible, 
I'd like to be able to do this in Hebrew as well, 
so this might be the relevant code I have been Searching for.

סבבה
